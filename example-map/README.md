# regen.nut: Example Map
If you want to compile the map yourself, you will need to grab the main `regen.nut` script and *also* the `button.nut` script which is used on the last level of Projectile Limit (Solider). 

Pack with something like [CompilePal](https://github.com/ruarai/CompilePal).

This map is showcased in the script demonstration video: https://youtu.be/N8VZVMei1zc
